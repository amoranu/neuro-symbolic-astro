"""Execution trace schema (NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_DESIGN.md §2.3).

The trace is what the LLM critic consumes when a prediction fails. It
captures every step of CF evaluation for one (chart, target_aspect,
epoch) triple: which rules fired, what their initial/modulated CFs
were, which were subsumed by yoga-bhanga, and the final aggregate.
